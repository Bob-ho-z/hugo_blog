I think there is still a lot of space for improvement in my programming ability, so I hope to do more coding exercises during university to improve my ability. In addition, I also lack practical experience. I hope to find an internship during the university to find out what is going on in the market, such as the specific requirements for IT talents in the market. Secondly, I can explore in the IT industry to find out which position I am suitable for.
Moreover, during the university, I hope i can continue to participate in more activities, not only to broaden my horizons, to make more friends, but also to exercise my various abilities such as oral English ability.
