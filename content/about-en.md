Hello, my name is He Zhanbo. I am currently in the third year of Computer Science at CUHK.

#### Personal character

I like learning new knowledge and exploring different things. Learning new knowledge can bring me a sense of success. In addition, I am more inclined to set a goal for myself and make a plan before do something. Setting a goal makes me feel certain and knows what I am doing. Making a plan allows me to know what I need to prepare in advance,What difficulties will be encountered and what solutions may be useful, and finally know what is the expected results. Making a plan can also make me aware of my progress while doing things, and make me more motivated to do things.

#### My university experience

I am currently in the third year of university. As a computer science student, I taked a lot of computer science courses and did some projects.
I completed a Card Game project in year 1. The card game is played a bit like a game which is called connect the dots. A deck of 52 cards is randomly placed on the table. The player and the computer play a round, and each round chooses two cards. If those two cards have the same value, the player in this round will score, and the two cards will be spread out and and these two cards cannot be selected. If all cards are revealed and the game is over.
In year 3, I made an operating system project. This project is mainly to test whether we are familiar with OS cognition. This project gave us an HD file and asked us to write a program to read the inode number of the specified file, and also asked us to read the specified paragraph in this file.
I worked with other friends to make a project called VivaBleeRaw outside of class. I made part of the UI of [VivaBlee website](https://www.vivablee.com/), and I also made a part of VivaBleeRaw Android UI with react native. However, as the design idea has undergone many changes, the app and web interface have also undergone many changes, and the pages I designed have also been modified. I participated in Jane Street's Virtual ETC with other friends in year 3 sem a. In this competition, we need to design a program to purchase financial products multiple times in a virtual stock to obtain profit.
In addition, I learned other IT knowledge in extracurricular courses such as HTML+CSS, Python, etc.

I also dabble in other areas besides IT. I participated in the Chung Chi Rowing College Team of CUHK in year 1 and year 2. Although I didn’t get a place in year 1 and cancelled the competition in year 2, i made a lot of friends at rowing college team. The days in the rowing team not only trained my physical fitness, but also trained my teamwork ability and how to deal with conflicts in interpersonal relationship , which made my network develop. In the year 1 summer, I participated in YMCA’s Sichuan trip. During this trip, I learned a lot about the history and knowledge of Sichuan water protection team. year 2 winter sem break, members of the rowing team and I went to ride bikes around Taiwan. It made me more proficient in dealing with interpersonal problems.

From the end of year 2 to year 3, I also served as the chairman of Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps sqn604 that based on CUHK Executive Committee. This made me get in touch with how to coordinate activities such as how to make financial reports to the college for reimbursement and how to estimate activity costs.
