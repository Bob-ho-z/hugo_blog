This is a project I completed on a programming course in year 1. In fact, it is a card game where two players play against each other. A deck of 52 cards is placed on the table. Each round one player turns over two cards. If the two cards have the same value, the player scores. The two cards become uncover. You can choose these two cards again until all the cards are turned over.

This is the menu of this Card Game. There are two modes, one is human-machine battle, and the other is machine-machine battle.
