I did a project called VivaBleeRaw in cooperation with other friends outside of class. I did part of the UI of the VivaBlee website, and I also used react native to do the VivaBleeRaw Android UI. However, due to the change of designed ideas, the app and web interface have been changed many times.The pages I designed have also been modified.
